<h2> Part B - Programming Questions </h2>

1. There are three robots named Ray, Ben, and Kevin. Initially, Ray has a string **S** of length **N**, while the other two robots have empty strings. We can make either of the following moves:

    Move 1: Remove the first character from Ray's string and append it to Ben's string.  
    Move 2: Remove the last character from Ben's string and append it to Kevin's string.

    You must perform either of the two moves mentioned above in such a way that the strings left with Ray and Ben are empty and the string left with Kevin is lexicographically the smallest. Your task is to return this lexicographically smallest string that Kevin has after completing this activity.

    **Note:** For any two given strings, a string is said to be lexicographically smaller than the other if it comes before the other string in the dictionary.

2. **Mean, Median, and Mode**

    Given 'n' integers, find their mean, median, and mode. You are required to fill in a function that takes as inputs an integer **input1** (1 ≤ input1 ≤ 1000) and an integer array **input2**, containing 'input1' integers, and returns **output1** as the mean, **output2** as the median, and **output3** as the mode. The mean and median must be correct to six decimal places.

    - **Mean:** Defined as the average of all numbers in the array.
    - **Median:** Defined as the middle element of the array. If n is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. If n is odd, the median is the middle element of the array.
    - **Mode:** Defined as the number in the array with the highest frequency. If many numbers have the same highest frequency, then the mode is calculated by breaking ties in favor of the smallest of the numbers.

    **Input Specification:**  
    - **input1:** Integer in the range of 1 ≤ input1 ≤ 1000, denoting length of input array.  
    - **input2:** Integer input array.

    **Output Specification:**  
    - Return **output1** (double) variable as the mean.  
    - Return **output2** (double) variable as the median.  
    - Return **output3** (int) variable as the mode.

    **Example 1:**  
    - input1: 3  
    - input2: {1, 2, 3}  
    - Output: 2.000000, 2.000000, 1  

    **Example 2:**  
    - input1: 5  
    - input2: {41, 18467, 6334, 26500, 19169}  
    - Output: 14102.200000, 18467.000000, 41  

3. **Minimum Cost to Reach the Destination**

    There are **N** cities in a country. George is initially at the airport in city 1 and he wants to reach city **N**. For any city **i**, there is either a flight to city **(i+1)** or to **(i+3)** if it exists. You have been given an array **A** with the costs of flight tickets for **N** cities. To find the cost of a flight ticket between any two cities **i** and **j**, you take the absolute difference of the costs of those cities in the array **A**. You can use the formula |a| = |Cost[i] - Cost[j]| to calculate the cost of a flight ticket, where |a| represents the absolute value of a.

    Your task is to find and return the minimum possible cost of a flight ticket required to reach city **N**.

    **Note:**  
    - The number of cities is always greater than 3.  
    - Assume 1-based indexing.

    **Input Specification:**  
    - **input1:** An integer value **N**, representing the number of cities.  
    - **input2:** An integer array **A**, representing the cost of tickets to reach the **i**-th city.

    **Output Specification:**  
    - Return the minimum possible cost of a flight ticket required to reach city **N**.

    **Example 1:**  
    - input1: 4  
    - input2: {1, 4, 5, 2}  
    - Output: 1  
    - **Explanation:** George takes a flight in the below optimal manner:  
        - From city 1 to city 4, as city 4 is the third next city to city 1, so the cost will be |1-2|=1. Hence, 1 is returned as the output.

    **Example 2:**  
    - input1: 6  
    - input2: {4, 12, 13, 18, 10, 12}  
    - Output: 10  
    - **Explanation:** George takes a flight in the below optimal manner:  
        - From city 1 to city 2, the cost will be |4-12| = 8.  
        - From city 2 to city 3, the cost will be |12-13| = 1.  
        - From city 3 to city 6, the cost will be |13-12| = 1.  
        - Therefore, the total cost is 8 + 1 + 1 = 10. Hence, 10 is returned as the output.
